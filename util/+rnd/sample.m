function duration = sample(time)
% TIMESAMPLER Sample a time from some distribution
%  If time is a single value, duration is that value.  If time = [min max],
%  then duration is sampled uniformally.  If time = [min, max, time const],
%  then duration is sampled from a exponential distribution, giving a flat
%  hazard rate.  If numel(time) > 3, duration is a randomly sampled value
%  from time.
